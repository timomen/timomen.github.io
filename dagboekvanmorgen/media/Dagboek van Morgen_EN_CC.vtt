00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:20.887
<b>Today I was at school nice and early</b>

2
00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:23.890
<b>... Which gave me extra time to work on my project</b>

3
00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:29.312
<b>Project...</b>

4
00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:32.315
<b>I am DEFINITELY not doing that today...</b>

5
00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:34.601
<b>Uhh, that will surely happen-</b>

6
00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.303
<b>Finn! You're going to be late for school!</b>

7
00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:38.405
<b>Oh, uh</b>

8
00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:39.205
<b>No worries</b>

9
00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.141
<b>my Diary says I'll be on time.</b>

10
00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:02.629
<b>This morning was quite exciting, </b>

11
00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.632
<b>I only just caught the bus...</b>

12
00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:08.551
<b>How exciting...</b>

13
00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:13.056
<b>[MOTHER] Finn! Does your diary say you'll catch the bus again?</b>

14
00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:16.976
<b>Yes! And only just!</b>

15
00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:18.661
<b>[MOTHER] Hurry up then!</b>

16
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.141
<b>Hey!</b>

17
00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:32.742
<b>Uhh...</b>

18
00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:33.993
<b>Hello?</b>

19
00:01:35.578 --> 00:01:37.547
<b>Do you read that Diary?</b>

20
00:01:37.547 --> 00:01:39.215
<b>Yes, of course!</b>

21
00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:41.167
<b>Why wouldn't I?</b>

22
00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:42.919
<b>Because then it wins, man!</b>

23
00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:45.922
<b>Everything in it seems to be correct because you believe it's correct!</b>

24
00:01:45.922 --> 00:01:48.491
<b>Do you know what happens if you don't read it?</b>

25
00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:51.277
<b>Yeah? Then you know nothing..</b>

26
00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.229
<b>Exactly! And that is freedom!</b>

27
00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.882
<b>You really don't get what true freedom is, man.</b>

28
00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.734
<b>You really have to experience it.</b>

29
00:01:57.734 --> 00:01:58.468
<b>By the way.</b>

30
00:01:58.468 --> 00:01:59.769
<b>Shouldn't you hurry up a bit?</b>

31
00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:01.271
<b>Your bus is about to leave.</b>

32
00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:02.555
<b>No problem!</b>

33
00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.357
<b>According to my Diary I'll catch it just in time anyway.</b>

34
00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:06.025
<b>And, nothing can influence my Diary</b>

35
00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.377
<b>So that's just how it is!</b>

36
00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:08.411
<b>You don't know that, huh!</b>

37
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:10.463
<b>Because, you don't read your diary.</b>

38
00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.271
<b>Ouch! There it goes!</b>

39
00:02:18.605 --> 00:02:21.991
<b>But how? My diary is always right!</b>

40
00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.027
<b>Heh, that stupid diary.</b>

41
00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:27.380
<b>Everything in it is correct because you believe it's correct</b>

42
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:29.215
<b>But how?!</b>

43
00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.000
<b>Look, I don't read my diary.</b>

44
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.552
<b>That means i am not in the system.</b>

45
00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.737
<b>The system, it didn't see me coming!</b>

46
00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:37.740
<b>So that made you slower, and you were late!</b>

47
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.058
<b>What is your name?</b>

48
00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.177
<b>Jens, Jens.</b>

49
00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:42.078
<b>Finn</b>

50
00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:44.180
<b>Now I am actually late.</b>

51
00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:57.243
<b>That Jens, he's really not in my Diary!</b>

52
00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.395
<b>Did I hear my name there?</b>

53
00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:01.064
<b>You really can't escape me.</b>

54
00:03:01.064 --> 00:03:02.365
<b>And that diary!</b>

55
00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:05.151
<b>And is this conversation in your diary too?</b>

56
00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:07.187
<b>Do you want to escape from the truth?</b>

57
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.173
<b>Everyone is so numbed by that diary</b>

58
00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:13.026
<b>So emotionlessly doing whatever it says.</b>

59
00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:14.344
<b>You know what?</b>

60
00:03:14.344 --> 00:03:16.396
<b>Throw that Diary in that trash can.</b>

61
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.632
<b>What? No! What is wrong with you?</b>

62
00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:22.635
<b>What do you have against a little book that predicts the future?</b>

63
00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:24.254
<b>It doesn't even do that!</b>

64
00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:27.257
<b>Everything in that Diary seems to be correct because you believe it's correct!</b>

65
00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.008
<b>So it's bullshit!</b>

66
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:31.678
<b>Just try it</b>

67
00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:34.681
<b>Try not listening to that Diary like a dog for once.</b>

68
00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:51.631
<b>I got up at 7:00</b>

69
00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.852
<b>Like always</b>

70
00:04:12.385 --> 00:04:15.989
<b>Like always, but not today.</b>

71
00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:46.035
<b>Good morning Mom.</b>

72
00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:49.038
<b>Finn! What on earth are you doing here?</b>

73
00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:51.841
<b>You always get out of bed at 7:00, don't you?</b>

74
00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:53.693
<b>Oh, I thought..</b>

75
00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:56.696
<b>I'm trying something new..</b>

76
00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:58.398
<b>Something new?</b>

77
00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.401
<b>But you know what it says in your diary, right?</b>

78
00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:02.719
<b>Yes..</b>

79
00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.888
<b>That I would eat peanut butter.</b>

80
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.261
<b>But not today..</b>

81
00:05:20.303 --> 00:05:21.888
<b>Mom...</b>

82
00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:24.891
<b>Today I'm doing things differently..</b>

83
00:05:34.951 --> 00:05:37.954
<b>Look at them, do you see it?</b>

84
00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.105
<b>What?</b>

85
00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:43.509
<b>No one looks up, everyone follows their little line from point A to point B.</b>

86
00:06:12.088 --> 00:06:14.090
<b>Why is no one helping?</b>

87
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:16.776
<b>Because it's not in their script..</b>

88
00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:20.546
<b>16:15, I walk in a straight line towards home</b>

89
00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.668
<b>Stopping is a flaw in the system.</b>
<b>Emotion is delay.</b>

90
00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:28.871
<b>What does it say in your little book, Finn?</b>

91
00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:33.993
<b>On the way home I enjoy the quiet</b>

92
00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.728
<b>and I think about tomorrow...</b>

93
00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.731
<b>Choose. That book. Or your humanity.</b>

94
00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:48.591
<b>Are you okay?</b>

95
00:06:51.094 --> 00:06:52.245
<b>What are you doing?</b>

96
00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.679
<b>This, this isn't right!</b>

97
00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.465
<b>I'm helping you, you're bleeding!</b>

98
00:07:32.952 --> 00:07:33.619
<b>Finn!</b>

99
00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:35.438
<b>You're forgetting your Diary!</b>

100
00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:37.690
<b>Oh..</b>

101
00:07:38.758 --> 00:07:41.761
<b>I, I don't need it...</b>

102
00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:59.545
<i>Everything in it seems to be correct because you believe it's correct!</i>

103
00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:04.016
<i>I thought freedom was something you were given..</i>

104
00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:05.318
<i>Not something you choose..</i>

105
00:08:07.487 --> 00:08:10.490
<i>Today, I write my own future.</i>

106
00:08:12.608 --> 00:08:13.910
<i>So it's bullshit!</i>
