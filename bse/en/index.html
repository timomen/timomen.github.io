    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>To use BrickStoryEngine, download the excecutable with the button above or with the direct link at <a
            href="https://www.timopollarini.nl/bse/release/BrickStoryEngine.exe">www.timopollarini.nl/bse/release/BrickStoryEngine.exe</a>.
        BrickStoryEngine is now also available for linux! it is build using WSL Debian gnu/Linux 12. Every feature is tested.
    </p>
    <h3>IMPORTANT: Things stopping the program from running</h3>
    <p>BrickStoryEngine currently does not function properly without a .story file, this is being worked on. For now,
        you can download and use <a href="https://www.timopollarini.nl/bse/testStory.story">testStory.story</a>. It is
        possible to replace, delete or make new situations and opions to make it your own.
        <strong>Put this file in your Documents folder</strong>, BrickStoryEngine searches for .story files in that
        directory. More about this in the section <em>Open</em>
    </p>
    <h4>AntiVirus</h4>
    <p>The program may be detected as a Trojan Virus by Windows Defender or other AntiVirus's, this is incorrect. Mark
        the program as safe and continue</p>
    <h4>Windows</h4>
    <p>Windows automatically blocks excecutables downloaded from the internet, fixing this requires a Certificate from
        Microsoft. This program does not have a Certificate.
        To bypass this, select the downloaded exe, press alt + enter (properties), click "Unblock" and click "OK" or
        "Apply".</p>

        after BrickStoryEngine.exe, this can be a local file (e.g. <code>file.story</code> or
        <code>..\Documents\file.story</code>), or a file somewhere else (e.g.
        <code>c:\users\user\OneDrive\mystory.story</code>). For a local file, the .story file must be in
        the same folder as BrickStoryEngine.exe (e.g. <em>Downloads</em>). When running BSE with this
